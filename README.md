Hello Microverse Project

In this project, I'm just setting a repository to show my Github workflow best practices. I include some example files such as: index.html with a title and styles.css with a basic style for the title.
I also set up a linters file to analyze my source code to flag programming errors, which after making the pull request came out with none.
